//tell audrey that there is a new seed
audrey.encore();//run audrey
```
## Image display

This scion only works with very small png images, because it doesn't matter about the width of the screen and cos it treats every pixel as a character. So a 120x120 pixels it'll print a mess of color characters.

Look at this image and you'll look the pixels respect the magenta text.
